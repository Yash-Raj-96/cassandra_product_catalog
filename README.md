# üõí NoSQL Database for E-Commerce ‚Äì Cassandra Product Catalog

This project demonstrates how to set up a simple e-commerce product catalog using **Apache Cassandra**, a distributed NoSQL database. It showcases how NoSQL databases efficiently handle large-scale data, which is crucial for applications like e-commerce.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This mini-project includes:

- Creating a **keyspace** for an e-commerce application.
- Defining a **product table** to hold catalog data.
- Performing **CRUD** operations: Insert, Select, Update, and Delete.
- Executing basic CQL (Cassandra Query Language) queries in `cqlsh`.

---

## üßæ Dataset Details

- **Dataset Name**: E-commerce Product Catalog (Manual Entry)
- **Size**: Less than 10 KB
- **Attributes**:
  - `product_id` (UUID)
  - `product_name` (text)
  - `price` (decimal)
  - `category` (text)
  - `stock` (int)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. **Install Apache Cassandra** on your system.
2. Start the Cassandra server:
   ```bash
   cassandra -f
   ```
3. Open the CQL shell:
   ```bash
   cqlsh
   ```
4. Run the queries provided below to create the keyspace and table.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Important Code Snippets

### ‚úÖ Create Keyspace
```sql
CREATE KEYSPACE ecommerce
WITH replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 1};
```

### ‚úÖ Create Product Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name text,
    price decimal,
    category text,
    stock int
);
```

### ‚úÖ Insert Product Records
```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price, category, stock)
VALUES (uuid(), 'iPhone 14', 79999.00, 'Smartphone', 50);
```

### ‚úÖ View All Products
```sql
SELECT * FROM products;
```

### ‚úÖ Update Stock
```sql
UPDATE products SET stock = 45 WHERE product_id = <your_product_uuid>;
```

### ‚úÖ Delete a Product
```sql
DELETE FROM products WHERE product_id = <your_product_uuid>;
```
